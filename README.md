## Description

This app allows the user to create and devour any burger they can imagine. The user submits their burger, adding it to the "Burgers on your mind" column. Each burger added to this list has a button that allows the user to "devour" the burger, moving the item to the "Burgers in your belly" column. [eat-da-burger](./screenshot.png)
       
Purpose: This app was created to categorize and display data, allowing the user to interact with the data on the front-end of the application.

The app takes the user input and inserts the data into a table. That data is returned to the browser and sorted based on certain conditions. Data is stored using mysql. Routes are created using Express. The view is generated using Handlebars. The application uses MVC structure to organize coding into models, views, and controllers. 

Technologies Used

* Express
* MYSQL
* Handlebars

Challenges: It was difficult at first to create the routes using the MVC structure, but after several attempts, I was able to do it.

Lessons Learned: I learned to use the MVC structure to orgainze my application. I also learned how to create an orm to query data and how to create views using Handlebars.

Future Development: In continued development of this application, I intend to improve the appearance of the application. I would also like to incorporate a delete and clear function.
